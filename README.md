# Graph Attention Networks reproduction and experimentation

This repository attempts to reproduce the Graph Attention Networks (GAT) paper using Pytorch, and includes experiments using variations of the model architectures used in the GAT paper.

## Requirements

To install required Python librairies:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

Once you've set up your environment, navigate to the folder where you cloned this repository, then into the "code" folder, then run `jupyter notebook`. Open the notebook of your choice and run all the cells.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance :

Test accuracies of 0.7800, 0.6720 and 0.8180 on the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed datasets, respectively.

## Contributing

This repository was made as part of the CS598 Deep Learning for Healthcare class at UIUC in the winter 2023 semeseter. Contributions are not welcome.
